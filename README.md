# Quizbowl-Question-Writing
This is a collection of my quizbowl question-writing projects.

Quizbowl is a competitive knowledge-based game played at the middle school, high school, collegiate, and open levels. In its standard format, two teams of four go head-to-head on a [packet](https://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/Quizbowl_lingo#packet) consisting of 20 tossup questions and 20 bonus questions, which are read aloud by a moderator. Tossups are paragraph-length [pyramidal](https://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/Pyramidality) questions with many clues on a single answerline that start difficult and gradually get easier. Players use a lock-out buzzer system on tossups with the goal of being the first one to buzz in with the correct answer, even if it means interrupting the moderator. Once a players has correctly answered a tossup, its respective bonus is read. Bonuses are shorter, three-part questions that the correct player's entire team can collaborate on to answer.

What makes quizbowl so great is its self-sufficient community; all questions are written and all tournaments are hosted by people who also actively play the game. Constant discussions of the theory of the game occur on [the forums](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/), past question sets are stored in the [Quizbowl Packet Archive](https://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/), detailed statistics are kept in the [Tournament Database](https://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/), and the game's history is recorded in the [Quizbowl Wiki](https://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page).

All questions in this repository are original content written and researched by me specifically for the question set in which they were appear.
